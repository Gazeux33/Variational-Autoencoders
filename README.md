# Variational-Autoencoders(VAEs)

## The project 

This project is an implementation of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) using PyTorch. VAEs are generative models that learn to represent high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional latent space and can generate new data samples similar to the training data.

## Features
+ Implementation of a Variational Autoencoder architecture.
+ Training pipeline for learning latent representations.
+ Generation of new data samples from the learned latent space.
